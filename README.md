# Python 101

It's better to use `pyvenv` with your python code
if you want to have the latest version of python:

```bash
# Setup
pyvenv .
# Activate
. ./bin/activate
# Deactive
deactive
```

Also, you can use [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv),
[poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) or other newer dependency management tools.
